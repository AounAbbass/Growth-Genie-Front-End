# Project Title
Project Genie Front-End

## Description
This project is a front-end display built using Next.js for components and styled with Tailwind CSS. 

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Navbar**: A preselected link called `MyPosts` opens the `MyProjects.js` component.

- **MyProjects Component**:
  - Contains horizontal nav-links: `Drafts`, `Scheduled`, `Published`, `Insights`.
  - Selecting the nav-links displays cards with `h1`, `p`, and font-icons such as `edit` and `delete`.
  - The cards are responsive and rearrange from horizontal to vertical alignment in mobile view.
- **Hamburger Menu**: On mobile, the left navbar turns into a hamburger icon at the top right, which, when selected, reveals a scrollable navbar.
